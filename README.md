# Integrated Project (Halloween Party)

Our assignment is a concentration game and will reward users for getting stars in the game.
 
## Design Process

Our design is extremely direct, we started off with a bootstrap template, and then we decided to give a specific font to it to make it cleaner. Our colour scheme is orange, purple and grey. Dull colours that signifies halloween themed.


- As a user type, I want to be able to have fun and get rewarded for having fun
- As a UI/UX designer, I want to be able to help my user navigate the website efficiently


## Features
1. A navigation bar
2. Register Account
3. Match Game
